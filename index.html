        <p>
          HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and
          content of web pages. It consists of a set of elements, known as tags,
          which define the different parts of a web page such as headings,
          paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. HTML provides the basic
          framework for displaying content on the web and serves as the backbone
          of every web page.

        <br />
        <p>
          CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and
          layout of HTML documents. It allows web designers to define how
          elements should be displayed on a web page, including properties like
          colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and responsive designs. By
          separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), developers
          can create visually appealing and consistent websites across different
          devices and screen sizes.

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>

        <p>
          JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for
          adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It runs
          directly in a web browser and allows developers to manipulate HTML and
          CSS elements, respond to user interactions (like clicks and input),
          perform calculations, make network requests, and more. JavaScript is
          essential for creating interactive web applications, ranging from
          simple form validation to complex single-page applications.

        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets Framework</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          A CSS framework is a prepped and ready-to-use CSS library (Cascading
          Style Sheets). The stylesheets collection makes the job of a UI
          developer easier. Rather than starting every project from scratch, a
          CSS framework gives them tools to quickly create a user interface that
          they repeat and tweak during a project. They also enable the creation
          of more standards-compliant websites. While quite challenging to use
          or ambiguous for beginners, senior developers who know the CSS
          framework sites‚Äô descriptions and buzzwords find them extremely
          useful.

        <br />
        <p>
          In computer programming, a framework is a foundation over which
          programmers can build their software. In a similar way, a JavaScript
          framework provides a base for the convenience of the programmers. It
          helps by providing a set of pre-written codes so the programmers would
          not need to start from scratch. Thus, they can use the framework as a
          structure for the JavaScript program or application they are working
          on.
